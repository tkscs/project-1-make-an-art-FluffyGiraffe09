# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like


2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?


3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?


4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?


5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?

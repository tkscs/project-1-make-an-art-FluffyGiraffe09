# Project Proposal

1. Roughly, what will your drawing look like
    a head of a cat with a heart above it. 

2. What are two variables you could use so that when you change each variable, the drawing changes?
    A variable for the size of the eyes and a variable for the width of the heart.

3. Where is there repetition in your drawing?
    There are two ears, several circles, and a lot of repetition with the whiskers because the code is repeated several times just with slightly different angles.

4. What are the main parts of your drawing? Are there clear sections or objects?
    There is the heart, the face, the nose, the ears, the whiskers, and the eyes.

5. How could you use a loop variable of a for loop? Is there somewhere in your drawing where something is repeated, but it's slightly different each time? Maybe the same object is repeated in different places, or maybe a similar object is repeated but with different sizes?
    The whiskers are repeated several times just with slightly different angles, so maybe I could use a loop variable for that part of the drawing.

6. Sketch your image, take a picture, and add it here
